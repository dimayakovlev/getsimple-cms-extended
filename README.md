# GetSimple Legacy Content Management System

**GetSimple Legacy** is a **simple**, **fast**, **efficient** and **flexible** flat-file content managment system.

It's independent fork of well known [**GetSimple**](https://github.com/GetSimpleCMS/GetSimpleCMS), based on stable version *3.3.16*.

The main goal of the development of **GetSimple Legacy** is to provide users with all the features and convenience of the familiar **GetSimple**, while ensuring stable operation on the latest supported versions of PHP.

In the development of **GetSimple Legacy** attention was paid to the need to maintain compatibility with plug-ins and design themes created for the original **GetSimple**, keeping system requirements to a minimum, simplicity and flexibility of use.

An important aspect is the possibility to transfer to **GetSimple Legacy** the accumulated practical user and development experience gained during work with the original **GetSimple**.

All this makes it possible to consider and successfully use **GetSimple Legacy** as a content management system for creating new websites and updating existing ones.
